    " - Create a matrix of size k + 1 by len(s) + 1 of booleans (all initialized to False).\n",
    " - Initialize the top row to True, since we can make 0 with anything (by not picking anything)\n",
    " - Initialize the left column to False (except for the one in the first row), since we can't make anything other      than 0 with nothing\n",
    " - Iterate over the matrix from top-to-bottom, then left-to-right:\n",
    "      - At each index A[i][j], look at A[i][j - 1] or A[i - last][j - 1] and set to True if any are true.\n",
